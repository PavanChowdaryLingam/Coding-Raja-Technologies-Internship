# Coding-Raja-Technologies-Internship

This repository contains the projects and tasks I successfully completed during my AI Internship with Coding Raja Technologies. The internship provided an excellent opportunity to work on a variety of AI-related challenges, enhancing my skills and knowledge in machine learning, data science, and AI development.

## CodingRaja Technologies - Artificial Intelligence Internship

### ChatBot using NLP

In this Artificial Intelligence internship, I have built a Chat Bot using Natural Language Processing. This project helped me build a strong foundation and understanding of NLP technologies.

## Overview

During the internship, I tackled several tasks that covered different aspects of AI and machine learning. Each project is documented in its respective directory, including the code, data, and relevant explanations. Here is a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

- **Task 1: ChatBot using NLP**
  - Description: Building a chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries in natural language using NLP techniques.
  - Files:
    - `main.py`: Python script containing the code for the chatbot.
    - `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and setup instructions.
    - `requirements.txt`: File listing the dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Chatbot**: Execute the `main.py` script to start the chatbot. You can do this by running:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Interact with the Chatbot**: Once the chatbot interface is launched, you can start interacting with it by typing messages and pressing Enter or clicking the "Send" button.

## Additional Notes

- This chatbot project is a basic implementation to demonstrate NLP concepts and chatbot functionality. Feel free to extend and customize it as needed.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out to the internship mentors for assistance.
