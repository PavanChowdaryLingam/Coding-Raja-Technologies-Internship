Coding Raja Technologies Internship - Task 1: Chatbot using NLP
Welcome to the Coding Raja Technologies internship! This repository contains the solution for Task 1, which involves building a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Project Overview
The goal of this task is to create a chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries in natural language. The chatbot is built using Python and leverages NLP techniques to interpret user input and generate appropriate responses.

Features
Natural Language Understanding: The chatbot employs NLP techniques to understand user queries.
Response Generation: Based on the user input, the chatbot generates relevant responses.
Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the chatbot through a graphical user interface (GUI).
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
